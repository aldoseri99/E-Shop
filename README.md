- **Coding Progress**: 
  - The group leader initiated the repository and project setup, handled authentication, user roles, and ensured database functionality.
  - Team members worked on their assigned CRUD operations, maintaining the websiteâ€™s functionality and covering the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) requirements.
  - Additional features were added to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the codebase and enhance the project.

- **Styling**:
  - While basic styling was not a priority initially, it was partially covered as progress slowed. However, the functionality was completed on time.
